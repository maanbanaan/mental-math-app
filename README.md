# Mental Math App
A simple and interactive web application to help users improve their mental math skills. The app is designed to mimic the difficulty and question styles of numerical assessments at trading firms. Try to be as fast as you can!

### Live demo: 
You can try the app here: [Quick Math](https://maanbanaan.github.io/mental-math-app/)

### Upcoming features
Some features I would like to add include:
- A timed mode
- Selectable difficulty levels
- Multiple choice mode

### Feedback?
Feel free to send any feedback about the app to manuel.jostijn@gmail.com. If you have completed assessments for trading/quant roles, I would love to hear from you!

### Why did I make this?
I got frustrated by the lack of free mental math practice designed to help prepare for trader assessments, so I decided to make my own.
